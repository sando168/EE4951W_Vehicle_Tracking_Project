# EE4951W_Vehicle_Tracking_Project
Design a single prototype of a vehicle which can connect to a WiFi network and receive commands from the network moving accordingly. ESP32 architecture is recommended to keep the vehicle small. Replicate the prototype to build at least one additional vehicle. Realize a video processing system that can monitor the positions of the vehicles which are assumed to move on a limited rectangular area on the floor of a lab. The video processing system should be able to output the coordinates of the positions of the vehicles and send instructions to them on how to move. The vehicles should be able to follow a specified path.
